# Quality Control ICS

This project builds two release specifications: One for the Customer and one for the MIS.<br/>
In addition a third, 'Both', development version is created by the CI process for use by the Working Group.

The content and style of each version is determined by the FrameMaker book and a FrameMaker document used as a template.<br/>
The book determines which documents are included, the template determines the style and conditional text settings.

## Both
Is the master working copy and contains all documents (including both covers). This should be the only book used for editing.
* Book: ICS-QC-Both.book
* Template: Template_ICS.fm

## Customer
The Customer version. The book contains a subset of documents and should not be used for editing.
* Book: ICS-QC-CUS.book
* Template: Template_ICS_Cus.fm

## MIS
The MIS version. The book contains a subset of documents and should not be used for editing.
* Book: ICS-QC-MIS.book
* Template: Template_ICS_MIS.fm
